/*
Summary:
myChannel := make(chan int) - creates myChannel which is a channel of type int
channel <- value - sends a value to a channel
value := <- channel - receives a value from a channel

Program doesnâ€™t immediately terminate.
This is because the act of sending to and
receiving from a channel are blocking.
main() function blocks until it receives
value from channel.
